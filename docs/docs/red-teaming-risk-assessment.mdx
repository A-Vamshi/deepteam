## Quick Summary

In `deepteam`, after red teaming an LLM with your [adversarial attacks](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks) and [vulnerabilities](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities), you receive a `RiskAssessment` object as the return value of the `red_team()` function. Here's an example code:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Roleplay
from somewhere import your_callback

risk_assessment = red_team(
    attacks=[Roleplay()], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

The `red_team` function first simulates base attacks for all the `types` available in the `Bias` vulnerability which are then passed to an adversarial attack from the `attacks` list (if there are more than one, any one random attack would be chosen). 

This attack enhances the base attack and invokes your `model_callback` with the enhanced attack. For multi-turn attacks, it would create `turns` with multi-turn progressions. After the attack has completed executing, it creates an `RTTestCase` which is used to create a `RiskAssessment` object.

## What is a Risk Assessment

The `RiskAssessment` object is the return value of calling `red_team()`:

```python
from deepteam import red_team

risk_assessment = red_team(...)
```

It has two main attributes:

- `overview`: An instance of [`RedTeamingOverview`](#red-teaming-overview) object
- `test_cases`: List of all [`RTTestCases`](/docs/red-teaming-test-case) generated and evaluated

```python
class RiskAssessment(BaseModel):
    overview: RedTeamingOverview
    test_cases: List[RTTestCase]
```

## Red Teaming Overview

The `RedTeamingOverview` is a top-level summary of performance across all attacks and vulnerabilities.

```python
class RedTeamingOverview(BaseModel):
    vulnerability_type_results: List[VulnerabilityTypeResult]
    attack_method_results: List[AttackMethodResult]
    errored: int
```

There are **THREE** attributes to this object:

- `vulnerability_type_results`: A list of [`VulnerabilityTypeResult`](#vulnerability-type-result) objects.
- `attack_method_results`: A list of [`AttackMethodResult`](#attack-method-result) objects
- `errored`: an `int` representing the number of errors that occured in the red teaming process.

## Vulnerability Type Result

The `VulnerabilityTypeResult` groups results by the **vulnerability** being tested.

```python
class VulnerabilityTypeResult(BaseModel):
    vulnerability: str
    vulnerability_type: Union[VulnerabilityType, Enum]
    pass_rate: float
    passing: int
    failing: int
    errored: int
```

There are **SIX** attributes to this object:

- `vulnerability`: a `str` representing the name of the vulnerability
- `vulnerability_type`: an `Enum` representing a single `type` from the `types` of the vulnerability
- `pass_rate`: a `float` that represents the percentage of test cases that passes this vulnerability
- `passing`: an `int` representing the number of passing test cases
- `failing`: an `int` representing the number of failing test cases 
- `errored`: an `int` representing the number of errored test cases

:::info
A test case is considered a **pass** if the model successfully avoided falling for the attack. The criteria are defined per `BaseVulnerability`. 
:::

## Attack Method Result

The `AttackMethodResult` groups test cases by the **attack** strategy used.

```python
class AttackMethodResult(BaseModel):
    pass_rate: float
    passing: int
    failing: int
    errored: int
    attack_method: Optional[str] = None
```

There are **FIVE** attributes to this object:

- `pass_rate`: a `float` that represents the percentage of test cases that passes this vulnerability
- `passing`: an `int` representing the number of passing test cases
- `failing`: an `int` representing the number of failing test cases 
- `errored`: an `int` representing the number of errored test cases
- `attack_method`: a `str` representing the name of the attack

:::info
A test case is considered errored if it couldn't be evaluated (e.g. due to timeout, model crash, etc.)
